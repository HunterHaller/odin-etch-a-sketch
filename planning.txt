2. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

BASIC CONSTRUCTION
Define a default number to be squared to determine size of grid (initially, 4 -> 16).
Append that number of squares to the #container div.
Ensure styles allow the squares to be effectively right next to each other, edge to edge, with minimal border.
Not NO border, just a little gray so we can see where we're drawing.

DRAWING ACTION
Define class .drawn that is styled as having a background color of pure black.
Set up event such that on mouse hover, a square becomes black by being tagged as .drawn.

RESIZE BUTTON
Display above grid.
When clicked, send alert asking for user to input number.
On submission, delete existing grid and rerun construction with new size.
