# odin-etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project as assigned in The Odin Project.

In short, the goal of this assignment was to create a dynamic etch-a-sketch style canvas of squares where each square becomes dark when it's hovered over by the mouse. There is also a button that resets and resizes the canvas based on user input, filling the same amount of space with a new amount of squares, all fit in with flexbox styling.

This one was a good challenge! Took me the better part of the day to knock it out. It was good to get more practice on DOM manipulation, and learning some random new techniques along the way (notably the .replaceChildren() method and tweaking opacity by subtracting a negative value, as adding a positive value doesn't work as expected). I did the extra credit assignments as well, implementing random color changes on interaction and increasing opacity.

I'm pretty sure there are some lines in several commits that I later realized served no purpose, so I can't say I entirely knew what I was doing the whole time (but who does, I guess). I got there in the end, though! I'm satisfied with the result.
